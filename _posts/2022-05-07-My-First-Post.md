Welcome to CyRace, a blog to document my progress in learning all things Cyber.

## Main areas of interest

- Automation
- Infrastructure as Code
- Penetration Testing
- Defensive Mechanisms

## Current Roadmap

### 0. Begin playing with IaC

First I plan on building simple VMs with Ansible & Terraform on my Proxmox Hypervisor. This will teach me the basics that I will then expand upon. After building simple VMs.

### 1. Build environments using IaC

After building simple VMs using the like of Ansible & Terraform, I plan on building complete environments using IaC. This will involve multiple VMs all talking to each other and possibly having a purpose, i.e. Web Server, Database.

### 10. Build Penetration Testing Environment

Once I have a firm grasp on building environments with IaC, I would like to build a lab to practice penetration testing. This lab will include Kali, target VMs and eventually defensive VMs that will be used to monitor and deter threats.
